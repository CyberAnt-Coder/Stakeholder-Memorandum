# Stakeholder Memorandum

**TO:** IT Manager, Stakeholders  
**FROM:** Anthony Tran  
**DATE:** (Today’s Date)  
**SUBJECT:** Internal IT Audit Findings and Recommendations  

Dear Colleagues,

Please review the following information regarding the Botium Toys internal audit scope, goals, critical findings, summary, and recommendations.

## Scope

- Current user permissions set in the following systems: accounting, endpoint detection, firewalls, intrusion detection system, security information, and event management (SIEM) tools.
- Current implemented controls in the following systems: accounting, endpoint detection, firewalls, intrusion detection system, security information, and event management (SIEM) tools.
- Ensure current user permissions, controls, procedures, and protocols align with necessary compliance requirements.
- Ensure current technology is accounted for, including both hardware and system access.

## Goals

- Adhere to the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF).
- Establish a better process to ensure systems are compliant.
- Fortify system controls.
- Implement the concept of least privilege in user credential management.
- Develop and establish policies and procedures, including playbooks.
- Ensure compliance requirements are met.

## Critical Findings (Must Be Addressed Immediately)

The following controls must be developed and implemented to meet the audit goals:

- Control of least privilege
- Disaster recovery plans
- Password policies
- Access control policies
- Account management policies
- Separation of duties
- Intrusion detection system (IDS)
- Encryption (for secure website transactions)
- Backups
- Antivirus software (AV)
- Manual monitoring, maintenance, and intervention
- Closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance
- Locking cabinets
- Locks

Policies must be developed and implemented to meet PCI DSS and GDPR compliance requirements. Additionally, policies must be developed to meet SOC1 and SOC2 guidance related to user access policies and overall data safety.

## Findings (Should Be Addressed, But No Immediate Need)

The following controls should be implemented whenever possible:

- Time-controlled safe
- Adequate lighting
- Signage indicating alarm service provider
- Fire detection and prevention

## Summary/Recommendations

It is recommended that critical findings related to PCI DSS and GDPR compliance be addressed immediately, as Botium Toys accepts online payments worldwide. Additionally, SOC1 and SOC2 guidance should be used to implement the concept of least privilege and develop policies and procedures for user access and overall data safety. Integrating IDS and AV into the current systems will help identify and mitigate potential risks, especially as legacy systems require manual monitoring and intervention. Developing disaster recovery plans and creating backups are crucial for business continuity in the event of an incident. To secure Botium Toys’ physical assets, locks and CCTV should be implemented for securing, monitoring, and investigating potential threats. Although not immediately required, implementing a time-controlled safe, adequate lighting, signage for alarm service providers, and fire detection and prevention systems will further enhance the security posture of Botium Toys.
